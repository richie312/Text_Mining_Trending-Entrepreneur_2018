"Jack Ma is not a genius nor a crook but a genius crook First everyone must understand that in China there is no real private enterprise which can reach Fortune  without Chinese Communist Government CCG's control behind it What worse is that the control is often not exercised by government but by top level corrupted government officials and their family members There is no secret that several most powerful CCG officials and their family members are the top shadow shareholders of Alibaba Second those top level government officials have used Alibaba to laundry hundreds of billions embezzled monies out of China mostly through now CCG controlled Hong Kong and into Western countries particularly the US Third Alibaba has no new technology nor innovation but just a cheap copy of Ebay and Amazon CCG has not only used Alibaba to stop foreign businesses such as Ebay and Amazon entering into Chinese market but also given Alibaba monopoly in Chinese market upon which Ma/Alibaba's successful myth is really about For example receiving deposits and paying interest are the financial and banking industries monopolied by the government and many individuals and entrepreneurs have been imprisoned or even punished with death penalty because of raising capitals among friends and local people Ma/Alibaba is the only non-state-run and non-banking business capable of receiving deposits and paying interest in China Ma gave numerous speeches all over the world about how he became one of the richest persons in the world and how to become successful and so on but none of what he said was true Ma simply is the smiling face of the most evil dictatorship regime in human history the CCG which imprisoned Liu Xiaobo the Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate till his death on July   - something that even Adolf Hitler was not dare to do Mostly importantly in return for CCG's favor Ma has shamelessly promoted for CCG the dictatorship ideology and publicly supported CCG's Tiananmen Square massacre in  using tanks and machine guns against its own peaceful people Ma is a new phenomena challenging the conscience of every one of us in this fast-changing world - do we still respect universal human values as our first priority or money is everything and we should do whatsoever we can to get money power and fame like Jack Ma"
