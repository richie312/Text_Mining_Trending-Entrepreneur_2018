"And a second note before watching this video just this morning I had an odd thought I remembered how recently one time I physically saw a product in a store and pointed it out to my husband didnt take a picture of it didnt post about it only physically saw it and then later that day Amazon advertised it to me I joked with my husband that there was a glitch in the matrix because somehow Amazon realized I saw this product and was trying to force me to acknowledge it again and buy it As if there is a chip in my brain that records what I see I dont actually believe this Anyway this morning I had the thought what if we the general public are the AI robots that are becoming self aware Weve always heard this theory that we may build robots that will take over but what if we are the robots I mean we go through life being influenced by what we have advertised to us from what is considered attractive in men and women to what kind of car we should be driving to what cereal we buy at the store And then to watch this and Naveen said something similar within the first five minutes tripped me out"
"This has been my favorite video so far I had to keep pausing it because I had so many thoughts going through my head that I couldnt focus on the new material and had to write thoughts down in order to fully grasp what was said next Great job great interview I am excited for the future with these findings I personally have noticed my own changes in my digestion severe stomach and bathroom issue for  years and chronic depression that I couldnt fully comprehend why they cleared up but I am pretty sure it is because of reducing the stressors in my environment practicing gratitude and changing the way I eat"

"quotAs the dot-com bubble ended in March  InfoSpaces stock fell from  to  by July  In March  even as the stock price declined Jain said InfoSpace would one day have a greater market-share than Microsoft Intel and Cisco combined Early the following year he sold  million of his own shares at an even lower price Jain led a merger with GoNet that was purchased with the shares Shortly afterwards the founder of GoNet quit and the company was reduced in size After the merger GoNet CEO Russell Horowitz became president of Infospace Also in  InfoSpace used a controversial accounting method to report  million in profits when in fact it had lost  million Company executives skirted SEC trading restrictions to sell large blocks of their personal stockbr /br /Jain resumed the role of CEO in  As revenues decreased Jain indicated to investor analysts that revenues were expected to go up even though all indicators showed a continued decline In  InfoSpace said its revenues would go up to  million then laid off  staff shortly afterwards Jain and many other executives sold their shares in the company just as the stock increased in response to investor analysts repeating Jains positive outlook on revenues The company then used misleading accounting practices to make it appear as though it was still growing For example it invested money in a company run by Jains brother with an agreement that his brother would also spend money on InfoSpace a practice that was referred to as quotbuying revenuesquot"

"On the subject of brain-gut communication many of us are unaware that we have a bunch of neurons in our gut area Essentially we have two not including the two halves of the brains in our heads two brains This could easily be the source of the idioms based around the idea of ""I just have a gut feeling"" being so prominent in our cultures across the worldbr /br /And who knows maybe that's how the microbiome communicates with our brains"
"If gut microbiome is the holy grail why doesnt he just state matter of fact that everyone just go NOW and get fecal transplants from their choice of super-human and be done with it  Blow your coloby away with a big anti-bio nuke then follow up with a healthy fecal transplant and be on your way"

"The opening analogy falls apart a bit for me since humans are far from the first potential AI creation of bacteria I do think of my body as an ecosystem and am still getting to know myself and learn to communicate with my body more effectively I am fascinated by how our thoughts have so much to do with our feelings--that feedback loop between our choices and the preferences of the microorganisms which comprise such a large part of our body I think of us less like a shell than as a different dimension of the evolution of life I believe we and the microbiome and so much else is all co-creating the next instant by way of our choices in this one/the now  I do hope to be able to sign up for Viome soon having struggled with chronic inflammation since pre-puberty and believing this research is fascinating and will help me gain more understanding of how I can communicate more effectively with my own body In a fractal sense I see this as learning to communicate more effectively with the entire Universe spanning in all directions Joy love and playfulness is transformative in my experience Science has not fully accounted for raising the vibration of various evolutionary processes by choosing to find joy playfulness--leaving room for the unmanifested potential of everything"

"Hi Tombr /br /I came across your channel pretty recently and I really love the message that the channel stands for Thank youbr /The one quote that brings me out from feeling low or feeling that things are not going anywhere is a quote quotWhen we hit our lowest point we are open to the greatest changequot from an anime series I use to watch It always helped me and I hope it helps others as well  Just sharing the scene if people want to watch that  min clip a href/Keep up the good work and thanks for interviewing so many inspiring and helpful people"

"I believe that the micro biome has everything to do with nutrition in terms of what the body can do with the food we ingest but there is so much more to explore in the area of a congested lymphatic system and the acidosis that comes from it Seek out Dr Robert Morse here on YouTube Specifically the great lymphatic system Poor elimination is the problem that leads to chronic conditions"
"it would be nice to have a guest expert on plant medicine shamanism ayahuasca and spiritual practices that can impact your health "
"This is an ancient science which he is repeating Ancient medicine of Ayurveda works precisely based on the principle that every human is unique and no one food is good for all individuals My wife was diagnosed with RA being vegetarian we would eat lot of chickpeas and legumes broccoli but these foods were poison for her body as this was causing inflammation Probably he should do more research on the same"
"Tom I know I have already commented but I just have to say again I hope you'll do more shows regarding this topic I've been on my own journey the last several years and have slowly been learning about leaky gut and some of the other things you guys were talking about in this episode and my heart is racing I have a new sense of hope that I will continue to feel better as I press forward I have already forwarded this episode to my nutritionist and my naturopath and I'm excited to see where all of this will lead in my health recovery Thank you so much for doing this"

"My major is nutrition and I plan on becoming a registered dietitian Ive actually been concerned of the RD job becoming obsolete due to AI prescribing diets still may happen but after seeing a seminar on the microbiome and plus this interview I feel like RDs will be necessary even more than they are now in order to read analyze translate microbiome tests and prescribe personalized diets based on that I have at LEAST  more years before I can become an RD lets see where the microbiome research will be by then PS I love these health theories episodes"

"I would give this  thumbs up if I could Please keep it up"
"Jain may be well meaning I hope so but some of the things he is suggesting are misleading and or simply false claims Im sorry if you dont want to hear that but I am speaking from a knowledge rich frame of reference and I can state with confidence that if Jain sold a product with packaging that made some of the claims he makes in the video he would be in legal trouble again  And before some fool jumps on me with some emotional fanboy style torrent of bullshit Id like to point out that I do understand the topic and do appreciate what one of Jains companies does and this is reflected in my familys lifestyle Perhaps Jain is just dumbing things down for the audience but if that is the case he is going a bit far and crossing over into territory that is more imagination than science which is unwise  br /br /The core idea is not new at all what do you think that this is all about quotLet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy foodquot - Hippocrates Approx  BCbr /br /And for health info that is put very clearly and with scientific rigour see Dr Greger's a hrefBasically if the Dr will back up your claims then they are truely solid and useful he is the most ethical unbiased and disiplined person talking about the topic on youtube today"
